## Hi there 👋

# 💫 About Me:
Heyy, I'm **Harini** — tea-fueled CSE student at VIT Chennai, trying to automate life one side project at a time 😎  
If it’s smart, quirky, or looks cool on the frontend *and* backend — I probably built it or broke it trying.  

- 🔭 Currently brewing: A **smart quiz app** that levels up (literally) as you do 🎯  
- 🌱 Currently learning: **Three.js**, **Node.js**, and how to make my LLMs less hallucinatey  
- 📫 Find me at: [harini.selvakummar@gmail.com](mailto:harini.selvakummar@gmail.com)  
- 🧠 Fun fact: Been dancing **Bharatanatyam** longer than I've been debugging 😅  
- 🏆 Flex corner: Ranked **13th out of 547** teams in a hackathon (Yes, I counted)

## 📌 Projects Worth Bragging About:

- 📊 [GitHub Analytics (Stockholm Project)](https://github.com/Harini-win/stockholm-github-users) – See your GitHub data like a boss. Probably overkill. Definitely worth it.
