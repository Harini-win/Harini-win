## Hi there 👋

# 💫 About Me:
Heyy, I'm **Harini** — tea-fueled CSE student at VIT Chennai, trying to automate life one side project at a time 😎  
If it’s smart, quirky, or looks cool on the frontend *and* backend — I probably built it or broke it trying.  

- 🔭 Currently brewing: A **smart quiz app** that levels up (literally) as you do 🎯  
- 🌱 Currently learning: **Three.js**, **Node.js**, and how to make my LLMs less hallucinatey  
- 📫 Find me at: [harini.selvakummar@gmail.com](mailto:harini.selvakummar@gmail.com)  
- 🧠 Fun fact: Been dancing **Bharatanatyam** longer than I've been debugging 😅  
- 🏆 Flex corner: Ranked **13th out of 547** teams in a hackathon (Yes, I counted)

- 📊 [GitHub Analytics (Stockholm Project)](https://github.com/Harini-win/stockholm-github-users) – See your GitHub data like a boss. Probably overkill. Definitely worth it.

## Harini’s Dev Bingo
“Cross 5 in a row and you get… existential dread?”
| ✅ | 🟥 | ⬜ | 🟥 | ⬜ |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| Added console.log that lives forever | Forgot semicolon, broke build | Dark mode > Light mode | Code worked. Don’t know how | "It worked yesterday" |
| Committed with message: "fix" | Fought Tailwind spacing for hours | Debugged more than coded | LLM said “I'm not sure…” | npm install broke everything |
| VS Code theme = identity crisis | git push --force and prayed | Broke production on Friday | Named file: final_final_v2.js | Figma handoff? Pain. |
| Quiz too smart for me | “5 more mins” to fix a bug | Learned lib to avoid real work | Coded in wrong file for 30 mins | Worked on friend’s laptop, not mine |

## ✨ Life Goals (via npm)

```bash
npm install confidence
npm install caffeine
npm install sleep --save-dev
npm uninstall imposter-syndrome
